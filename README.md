- This repository contains code for the analysis of Olink plasma proteomic data to identify biomarkers associated with tuberculosis (TB) disease progression. The data include three groups (e.g. IGRA-negative healthy controls, IGRA-positive non-progressors, and progressors), with NPX values for each protein.
